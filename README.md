# Jekyll boilerplate and gulp configuration

WIP and just a snapshot for version control and backup. Intended for my own use and education, so beware! (:

  I will give proper credit as soon as I find time but until then I at least have to state, that I heavily built upon [Hugo Giraudel's](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel) 7-1 sass boilerplate.
